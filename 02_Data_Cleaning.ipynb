Also, it changes with time of day, trip distance requested, traffic on the route, etc. Even, a study shows that, in India, fares are different for same trip on mobile phones with different operating systems. That is, on Iphones, app might ask for more money than on an android phone. Now, after moving to US, I am interested in studying the taxi systems here. Beyond my personal interest, the study might help customers with transparency and predictability as well as it might help companies in understanding revenue patterns.\n",
